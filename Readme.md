TMN project readme
======================

Objective
----

> A few days before Christmas I got lucky with a reply from trumedianetworks.com after applying for the opportunity: 

> **SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER**

> *trumedianetworks.com passed on my contribution without an interview*.

> The reply from trumedianetworks included an attached .zip file with instructions in PDF and 3 type json data files.

> The task: display the 3 NFL QBs on separate pages with accompanying stats.

> * Think time: off and on over the holidays.
> * Coding time: about 1 day.
> * The design consideration:
>> * A basic HTML5 SPA.
>> * No documenttype switching or sniffing
>> * Pure JS
>> * No JavaScript libraries
>> * No CDN
>> * Limit external references.

> * Usage: on the index page click the link [NFL QBs][1] to redirect to the tabulated statistics page.

> To see QB stats pull down and select 1 of 3 QBs corresponding to each json data file and click: **HUT! HUT!**

> With no QB selected from the dropdown click the **HUT! HUT!** button to clear the session storage.

> There were 2 validation errors.

> The tmn_proj_basic was deployed and tested on
 
>> * Apache web server 2.4.7
>> * nginx version: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

> The remaining links and references are listed below.
